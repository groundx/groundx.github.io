At **GroundX.IO**, over the years we founded or contributed to several software projects for binary analysis & reverse engineering. Some of them have been widely used in the security community, as follows.

- [OptiROP](https://media.blackhat.com/us-13/US-13-Quynh-OptiROP-Hunting-for-ROP-Gadgets-in-Style-WP.pdf): Sematic-level Return-Oriented-Programming tool (PDF slides only, no public release)

- [Capstone](https://www.capstone-engine.org): multi-arch disassembler framework

- [Unicorn](https://www.unicorn-engine.org): multi-arch (instruction level) emulator framework
 framework
- [Keystone](https://www.keystone-engine.org): multi-arch assembler

- [Keypatch](https://www.keystone-engine.org/keypatch): binary patching plugin for IDA

- [Skorpio](/docs/Opcde2018-skorpio.pdf): multi-parch dynamic instrumentation framework (PDF slides only, no public release)

- [Darko](/docs/ZeroNights2017-darko-fuzzer.pdf): multi-arch binary fuzzer (PDF slides only, no public release)

- [Qiling](https://qiling.io): Operating System level emulator

- [Demigod](/demigod/): OS kernel emulator

- [Redback](/redback/): high-level static binary injection
